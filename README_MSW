Windows Compilation Issues:
=====================================

mode_t is defined on wxWidgets and PHP at the same time

	Fix: Comment out on PHP source TSRM/tsrm_virtual_cwd.h the following:
		typedef unsigned short mode_t;
		
	Then when the zend engine files are compiling you are going to receive
	a compilation error, so uncomment the line again and nmake to continue compiling
		
wxPosScriptDC Not enabled by default on wxMSW

	Fix: On wxWidgets lib\vc_lib\mswu\wx\setup.h set:
		wxUSE_POSTSCRIPT 1
