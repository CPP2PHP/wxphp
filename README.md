wxPHP stands for "wxwidgets for PHP" and it is a binding for the great 
cross-platform library [wxWidgets](http://wxwidgets.org/) used to 
develop GUI applications. The purpose is to bring all the facilities 
available on PHP as easyness of programming to assist on the development
of cross-platform desktop applications. The syntax used is very similar 
to the one used on original implementation of wxWidgets C++, making it 
easier for people already familiar with the library.
