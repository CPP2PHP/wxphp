php5-wxwidgets (2.9.4.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial debianization
  * Added template.rc that includes wxWidgets resources for windows build.
  * Fixed inno setup script.
  * Updated readme.md and readme
  * Regenerated source code to apply the fix for arguments type checking.
  * Fixed function/methods generation code to also check if the argument 
    type is the same as original and not only a class that inherits from 
    the original type.
  * Disabled wxNativeFontInfo methods: GetPixelSize and SetPixelSize, 
    since they are undefined symbols when compiling the extension. 
  * Re-generated the code with warning message disabled for top level 
    windows and more constants available like wxRAISED_BORDER.
  * Added gitignore file.
  * Now the code generator does not skip #defines that mirror an enum, 
    like wxRAISED_BORDER mirrors wxBORDER_RAISED.

  * Updated version information on template file.
