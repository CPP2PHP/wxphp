Code generator
------------------------
File: parser.php:

This script reads the files on the dumps directory and 
generates the source code that wraps the wxWidgets classes.

It uses a semi-template based system to facilitate editing the desired
generated code.


Using the source maker:
------------------------
cd source_maker	
php parser.php

This will produce 5 files:
	classes.h
	clases.cpp
	php_wxwidgets.h
	wxwidgets.cpp
	common.h
	
It also generates a file named discarded.log that stores all methods
and functions that were removed from the source code generation for
various reasons.

The generated source files are meant to replace the ones in the module 
source root.

To make the process simpler you can use the utility go.sh/go.bat 
to automatically update the source files.


Dumps
------------------------
The dumps directory holds the json text files, result of parsing the 
wxWidgets documentation with the xml_parser script. The files are pretty 
printed to make manual edition possible as easier integration of patches.
Previously standard php serialize functions were used making impossible 
to edit them. We thought about using the xml format but the most easier 
format to convert php arrays to human editable files was json.

Files on the directory:

	classes.json:
		Classes and it's methods with detailed information.
		
	classes_variables.json
		Store the member variables of classes (not implemnted yet)
		
	consts.json 
		#define macro names and the values.
		
	enums.json
		Class enumerations and global enumerations.
		
	functions.json
		wxWidgets global functions with detailed information.
		
	global_variables.json
		Various global variables found while parsing like wx_NORMAL_FONT
		
	includes.json
		The include files of the parsed files (this include files are
		added to common.h for correct compilation)
		
	typedef.json
		Name of variables declared as typedef with 
		the original type value.
		
		
Source Templates
------------------------
The source_templates directory has the files that serve as the skeleton
of the wxWidgets php extension. These files have some comment tags or 
php variables inserted that the code generator uses to insert the 
neccesary source code to declare classes, constants and functions.

		
Templates
------------------------
The templates directory holds files with parts of the skeleton that are 
goind to be inserted by the code generator on the classes.cpp and classes.h
files. The templates files are used in combination of some functions 
declared on the include directory. The idea is to make edition of output
code much easier.


Class Selector
------------------------
The directory class_selector has the GUI utility (written with wxPHP
itself) used to inspect and enable/disable bindings.

To use this utility you need to have a working library of wxPHP and run:

php /path/to/source_maker/class_selector/selector.php
