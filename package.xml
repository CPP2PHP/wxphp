 <notes>
  * Updated the thread.php example to work properly.
  * Remove delete on the wxThread garbage collector function, which 
    should fix most issues on #84.
  * Modified wxWindow::GetHandle to return the XWindowID on Gtk which 
    should really fix #86.
  * Enabled wxWindow::GetHandle by casting WXWidget to size_t.
  * Enabled wxOutputStream::Write and wxInputStream::Read variations 
    that take a 'void* buf' as argument which should fix issue #87
  * Updated version numbers and added userland version constants: 
    WXWIDGETS_LIBRARY_VERSION and WXWIDGETS_EXTENSION_VERSION.
  * Added --with-wxwidgets-version to package.xml so 'pecl install 
    wxwidgets' can ask for a different version of wxWidgets library to 
    download and compile.
  * Set the default wxWidgets version to download and compile on linux 
    and mac to 3.0.2. Also added a new configure option 
    --with-wxwidgets-version to explicitly change the version of 
    wxWidgets to download, eg: --with-wxwidgets-version=3.0.1
  * Forgot to conditionally fetch tsrm on wxAppWrapper.
  * Fetch TSRM on wxAppWrapper which probably fixes issue #70
  * Unmodified copy of wxImage::GetData to zval which fixes #75.
  * Own the data parameter on wxImage SetData to really fix issue #75.
  * Custom templates for wxImage GetData and SetData which fix 
    and close #75.
  * Updating location of Mac OS X SDK in docs (chrisnharvey).
  * Updating docs for building on Mac OS X (chrisnharvey)
  * Updating link to heading
  * Updating macosx-version-min to 10.9
  * Added sdl, sdl_sound as dependencies on archlinux PKGBUILD.
  * Updated config.m4 to require sdl and sdl_sound on linux which 
    fixes #2.
  * Removed some testing printf code.
  * Added some wxApp methods.
  * Fix to correctly brake search for wx-config when first found in 
    config.m4 file.
  * Added wxPHP shell script in /usr/bin/wxphp.
  * Added some wxApp methods.
  * Automated Mac OSX detection which should fix #94.
  * Simplified README.md and added building steps into INSTALL.md.
  * Removed trace of debugging code.
  * Merge child class method overrides that differ into parent methods 
    which should fix #97.

  * Fixed wxInputStream::OnSysRead thanks to johannes from pecl. This 
    functionality should be enough for loading images from phar files 
    as described on issue #35.
  * Moving mac process transformation code to wxEntry (chrisnharvey).
  * Enabled some MacOSX specific wxApp virtual methods as requested by ydk2.
  * Modified bool wxApp::OSXIsGUIApplication() to return true by 
    default if no user space side function is found.
  * Improved config.m4 and added initial support for macosx.
  * Fixed some segfaults on macosx due to newly introduced wxApp 
    virtual methods which may be called with an uninitialized phpobj.
  * Added curl as another option to download wxWidgets from config.m4.
  * Improved wxExecute function.
  * Added macosx bundle icon.
  * also search for wx-config-3.0 (remicollet)
  * Type casted to void* on memcpy calls.
  * Added tool to generate Mac OSX bundles of wxphp.
  * Fixed mac osx segfault caused by incrementing the refcount on 
    objects returned by static methods.
  * Renamed xml_parser.php to json_generator.php.
  * added the way to work with conflicting mode_t declaration needs 
    some header in wx distro to be patched (weltling)
  * Removed template.rc (weltling)

  * Added missing wxScrolledWindow methods by enabling wxScrolled, 
    this fixes issue #30 and #32.
  * Enabled wxClipBoard::Get() and disabled gargbage collection of 
    native_object on wxDataObject and its childs as wxClipBoard itself, 
    which partially fixes issue #34.
  * Added verification of object parameter child types to allow method 
    calls which where failing as described on issue #36. This also 
    completely fixes issue #34, testing may be needed.
  * Updated README_MSW adding changes needed to prevent windows xp 
    crashes as described on issue #37.
  * Enabled wxNonOwnedWindow::SetShape and fixed wxPrintDialog, 
    wxPageSetupDialog inheritage.
  * Removed error messages that appeared when failing to call 
    wxApp::OnInit and wxApp:OnExit.
  * Added proper type casting to wxMouseState.
  * Should fix and close #44 by doing proper type casting when calling 
    wxKeyboarState methods from child classes.
  * Binded the missing wxAuiNotebookEvent event constants which closes #45.
  * Enabled more wxStyledTextCtrl methods. 
  * Enabled inheritance of wxStyledTextCtrl from wxTextEntry as 
    enabled some more methods.
  * Some fixes to the reference and interface generator as 
    simplification of chdir() calls.
  * Initial work to support wxInputStream::OnSysRead in order to be 
    able to load images with the wxImage(wxInputStream) constructor.
  * Fixed 2 memory leaks, one related to wxEvtHandler::OnEvent and the 
    other related to the creation of new objects.
  * Fixed memory leak caused by not uninitializing the properties 
    member of classes like wxPoint when they were destroyed which 
    closes #48, also modified code generator to only add the properties 
    code when needed which made the source and library more clean.

  * Initial debianization
  * Added template.rc that includes wxWidgets resources for windows build.
  * Fixed inno setup script.
  * Updated readme.md and readme
  * Regenerated source code to apply the fix for arguments type checking.

    since they are undefined symbols when compiling the extension. 
  * Re-generated the code with warning message disabled for top level 
    windows and more constants available like wxRAISED_BORDER.
  * Added gitignore file.
  * Now the code generator does not skip #defines that mirror an enum,
