Mac OSX Bundle Generator
========================================================================

On this directory you will find a script to generate  Mac OSX bundle
with php and wxphp. The script will ask you some information about
the bundle you are going to generate and then it will proceed to compile
launcher.cpp, php and wxphp. It will take a long time if you haven't 
compiled php and wxphp already. 

After the script finishes you can modify the launcher.sh script inside
your application.app/Contents/MacOS/launcher.sh to meet your needs as change
the icon in application.app/Contents/Resources/icon.icns

========================================================================
bundle_generator.php:
========================================================================

To start generating the bundle execute:

php bundle_generator.php

Note: You can execute the script from any directory where you want to 
save the generated bundle but the bundle_generator.php script must 
reside on the wxphp source tree.

For example:

    user@machine:~/Development$ php ~/wxphp/tools/macosx_bundle/bundle_generator.php

That would generate the bundle in a directory named Development.
