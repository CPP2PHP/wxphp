Building in Windows
========================================================================

. Download and install wxWidgets 2.8
	make sure to have your enviroment variables configured.
	set LIB=%LIB%;%WXWIN%\lib\vc_lib
	set INCLUDE=%INCLUDE%;%WXWIN%\include
	set INCLUDE=%INCLUDE%;%WXWIN%\include\msvc

. Put the source code in the ext folder of your php build folder, ext/wxWidgets

. Configure your php:
	cscript /nologo configure.js  "--enable-wxWidgets=shared"

. Build it:
	nmake php_wxwidgets.dll
	
	
	
Building and Installing on Linux
========================================================================

. Install wxWidgets library and development packages

	Ubuntu 10.04:
		apt-get install libwxgtk2.8-0 libwxgtk2.8-dev
	
. Install php5 development packages 

	Ubuntu 10.04:
		apt-get install php5-dev
	
. Some necessary changes
	By default the extension is set to build with a debug version of wxWidgets.
	In order to compile with no debug build of wxWidgets you would need to
	open config.m4 with your favorite text editor and remove all the --debug flags
	found on the file.
	
	Another change necesarry when building with PHP 5.3.x versions is on 
	frame.cpp source file. Search for the line that reads:
	
		ZVAL_ADDREF(*fc_obj); 
		
	and change it to:
		
		Z_ADDREF_P(*fc_obj);
	
	
. Configure and build the extension
	cd wxphp
	phpize
	./configure
	make
	
. Installing the extension
	Copy the resulting wxwidgets.so file on the modules directory to the php 
	extensions directory. PHP extensions directory is usually found on /usr/lib/php5/
	On ubuntu 10.04 this directory is /usr/lib/php5/20090626/
	
	If you want the wxWidget extension to be automatically loaded, add the
	following lines to your php.ini:
	
		; load php wxwidgets module
		extension=wxwidgets.so
