Introduction
========================================================================

	wxPHP is a binding of wxWidgets (http://wxwidgets.org/) with the purpose 
	of bringing all the rapid application development tools available on PHP 
	to assist on the development of desktop applications. The syntax used is 
	very similar to the one used on original implementation of wxWidgets C++,
	but much simpler. So if you are an intense PHP web developer, you can 
	explore the new possibilites that wxWidgets brings to the table while
	still using PHP.
	
	

Building in Windows
========================================================================

. Download and install wxWidgets 2.8
	make sure to have your enviroment variables configured.
	set LIB=%LIB%;%WXWIN%\lib\vc_lib
	set INCLUDE=%INCLUDE%;%WXWIN%\include
	set INCLUDE=%INCLUDE%;%WXWIN%\include\msvc

. Put the source code in the ext folder of your php build folder, ext/wxWidgets

. Configure your php:
	cscript /nologo configure.js  "--enable-wxWidgets=shared"

. Build it:
	nmake php_wxwidgets.dll
	
	
	
Building and Installing on Linux
========================================================================

. Install wxWidgets library and development packages, currently we have
  tested with latest 2.8.x branch distributed on wxwidgets.org

	Ubuntu 10.04:
		apt-get install libwxgtk2.8-0 libwxgtk2.8-dev
	
. Install php5 development packages 

	Ubuntu 10.04:
		apt-get install php5-dev
	
. Some necessary changes
	By default the extension is set to build with a debug version of wxWidgets.
	In order to compile with no debug build of wxWidgets you would need to
	open config.m4 with your favorite text editor and remove all the --debug flags
	found on the file.
	
	Another change necesarry when building with PHP 5.3.x (only on older revisions of wxPHP)
	versions is on frame.cpp source file. Search for the line that reads:
	
		ZVAL_ADDREF(*fc_obj); 
		
	and change it to:
		
		Z_ADDREF_P(*fc_obj);
	
	
. Configure and build the extension
	cd wxPHP
	phpize
	./configure
	make
	
. Installing the extension
	Copy the resulting wxwidgets.so file on the modules directory to the php 
	extensions directory. PHP extensions directory is usually found on /usr/lib/php5/
	On ubuntu 10.04 this directory is /usr/lib/php5/20090626/
	
	If you want the wxWidget extension to be automatically loaded, add the
	following lines to your php.ini:
	
		; load php wxwidgets module
		extension=wxwidgets.so
	

Running the sample
========================================================================

In order to run the sample you need to install php cli version.
On ubuntu this is done by running:

	sudo apt-get install php5-cli
	
To run the sample just run:

	php sample.php
	
on windows you can also do
	
	php-win sample.exe
