run.php:

This script takes the output of gccxml (http://www.gccxml.org/) "wx.xml", 
and produces 2 files "consts.dump" and "classes.dump". These files contain
a serialized mapping interpretation of the library methods, and constants.

It's usefull, but it's not complete. There are some problems at variable types 
interpretation. Every time that happens, the type is replaced by a "ref: [0-9]+"
string.

The output of this script, is the input for srcMaker/srcGui scripts.

In linux:
gccxml ../common.h -fxml=wx.xml -I/usr/lib/wx/include/gtk2-unicode-release-2.8 -I/usr/include/wx-2.8 -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -D_LARGE_FILES -D__WXGTK__ -I/usr/include/php5 -I/usr/include/php5/main -I/usr/include/php5/TSRM -I/usr/include/php5/Zend -I/usr/include/php5/ext -I/usr/include/php5/ext/date/lib

If having an error that outputs:

/usr/include/bits/fcntl2.h: In function 'int open(const char*, int, ...)':
/usr/include/bits/fcntl2.h:44: error: '__builtin_va_arg_pack_len' was not declared in this scope
/usr/include/bits/fcntl2.h:49: error: '__builtin_va_arg_pack_len' was not declared in this scope
/usr/include/bits/fcntl2.h:57: error: '__builtin_va_arg_pack_len' was not declared in this scope

Then you need to update a gccxml header file (/usr/share/gccxml-0.9/GCC/4.x/gccxml_builtins.h). 

Find the line that reads:

bool __builtin_va_arg_pack(...);

and replace it with

bool __builtin_va_arg_pack(...);
int  __builtin_va_arg_pack_len(...);
