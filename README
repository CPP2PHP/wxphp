Introduction
========================================================================

wxPHP is a binding of wxWidgets (http://wxwidgets.org/) with the purpose 
of bringing all the rapid application development tools available on PHP 
to assist on the development of desktop applications. The syntax used is 
very similar to the one used on original implementation of wxWidgets C++.
	



Building in Windows
========================================================================

. Requirements
	
	* Windows SDK 6.1
	* Visual C++ 2010 Express Edition
	* wxWidgets 2.8.12
	* PHP5 Sources
	* wxPHP source code
	* Read the README_MSW
	
. Install Windows SDK 6.1 and Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition

	Windows SDK 6.1 download links:
		
		Web Setup - http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=11310
		
		or
		
		DVD ISO - http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=F26B1AA4-741A-433A-9BE5-FA919850BDBF&displaylang=en
		
	Visual Studio 2008 Express Edition download links:
	
		http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2008-editions/express
	
. Download and install wxWidgets Latest SVN 

	Checkout svn sources:
	
		svn checkout http://svn.wxwidgets.org/svn/wx/wxWidgets/trunk wxWidgets
	
	Open Windows SDK 6.1 CMD Shell:
		
		setenv /release /x86 /xp
		cd wxWidgets_Installation_Path
		cd build\msw
		nmake -f makefile.vc BUILD=release

. Download and Install PHP sources

	NOTE: At time of writing compilation was tested against 
		  PHP 5.3.11 but it should work with almost any prior 
		  5.3.x version

	Download PHP 5:
	
		To check available versions for download:
		
			http://windows.php.net/download/ 
			
		Direct download link for 5.3.11:
		
			http://windows.php.net/downloads/releases/php-5.3.11-src.zip
			
	Create the directory:
		
		c:\php-sdk
	
	Download PHP 5 binary tools:
		
		http://windows.php.net/downloads/php-sdk/
	
	Extract the binary tools inside the directory c:\php-sdk leaving 
	you with:
	
		c:\php-sdk\bin
		c:\php-sdk\script
		
	Open the Windows SDK 6.1 CMD Shell and do the following:
		
		setenv /release /x86 /xp
		cd c:\php-sdk\
		bin\phpsdk_setvars.bat
		bin\phpsdk_buildtree.bat php53dev
		
	Extract the php source files and place them on:
	
		c:\php-sdk\php53dev\vc9\x86\php5.3.x
		
	Then compile the sources to see if everything is working:
	
		cd c:\php-sdk\php53dev\vc9\x86\php5.3.x
		buildconf
		configure --disable-all --disable-zts --enable-cli
		nmake

. Compile wxPHP

	Get wxPHP sources:
		
		svn co http://wxphp.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/wxphp/trunk wxphp
	
	Put the source code in the ext folder of your php build folder:
	
		c:\php-sdk\php53dev\vc9\x86\php5.3.x\ext\wxphp
		
	Make sure to read the README_MSW for some compilation
	and linking fixes
		
	Open the Windows SDK 6.1 CMD Shell and do the following:
	
		setenv /release /x86 /xp
		cd c:\php-sdk\
		bin\phpsdk_setvars.bat
		cd c:\php-sdk\php53dev\vc9\x86\php5.3.x
		buildconf
		configure --disable-all --disable-zts --enable-cli --with-wxwidgets=C:\wxWidgets_installation_path,shared
		nmake
		
	Copy the resulting php_wxwidgets.dll file on the Release directory 
	to the php extensions directory of your current PHP 5 VC9 X86 Non 
	Thread Safety setup.

	If you want the wxWidget extension to be automatically loaded, 
	add the  following lines to the end of your php.ini:
	
		[PHP_WXWIDGETS]
		extension=php_wxWidgets.dll

	
	

Building and Installing on Linux/Unix Environments
========================================================================

. Compile wxWidgets library and development packages, currently we have
  tested with latest svn revision 71250 distributed on wxwidgets.org

	Download wxWidgets tar file and uncompress it on your
	directory of choice on the console change to that directory
	and:
	
		./configure --prefix=/opt/wxWidgets-svn --enable-monolithic
	
. Install php5 development packages 

	Ubuntu 10.04 (and most debian based distros):
		
		apt-get install php5-dev
	
. Configure and build the extension
	
	cd wxPHP
	phpize
	./configure --with-wxwidgets=/opt/wxWidgets-svn
	make
	
. Installing the extension
	Copy the resulting wxwidgets.so file on the modules directory to the php 
	extensions directory (you can make this file smaller by running strip
	on it). PHP extensions directory is usually found on /usr/lib/php5/
	On ubuntu 10.04 - 11.10 this directory is /usr/lib/php5/20090626/
	
	If you want the wxWidget extension to be automatically loaded, add the
	following lines to your php.ini:
	
		; load php wxwidgets module
		extension=wxwidgets.so
		
	If not, then enable dynamic loading on your php.ini usually on:
		
		/etc/php5/cli/php.ini
		
		modify enable_dl = off to enable_dl = on
	



Running the examples
========================================================================

In order to run the examples provided you need to install php cli version.
On ubuntu this is done by running:

	sudo apt-get install php5-cli
	
To run the examples change on your console to the examples directory
and run the php interpreter on each file:

	php thread.php
		
on windows you can also do
	
	php-win thread.php
