Introduction
========================================================================

wxPHP is a binding of wxWidgets (http://wxwidgets.org/) with the purpose 
of bringing all the rapid application development tools available on PHP 
to assist on the development of desktop applications. The syntax used is 
very similar to the one used on original implementation of wxWidgets C++.
	
	

Building in Windows
========================================================================

. Download and install wxWidgets 2.9.3
	make sure to have your enviroment variables configured.
	set LIB=%LIB%;%WXWIN%\lib\vc_lib
	set INCLUDE=%INCLUDE%;%WXWIN%\include
	set INCLUDE=%INCLUDE%;%WXWIN%\include\msvc

. Put the source code in the ext folder of your php build folder, ext/wxWidgets

. Configure your php:
	cscript /nologo configure.js  "--enable-wxWidgets=shared"

. Build it:
	nmake php_wxwidgets.dll
	
	
	
Building and Installing on Linux
========================================================================

. Compile wxWidgets library and development packages, currently we have
  tested with latest 2.9.3 distributed on wxwidgets.org

	Download wxWidgets tar file and uncompress it on your
	directory of choice on the console change to that directory
	and:
		./configure --prefix=/opt/wxWidgets-2.9.3 --enable-monolithic
	
. Install php5 development packages 

	Ubuntu 10.04:
		apt-get install php5-dev
	
. Configure and build the extension
	cd wxPHP
	phpize
	./configure --with-wxwidgets=/opt/wxWidgets-2.9.3
	make
	
. Installing the extension
	Copy the resulting wxwidgets.so file on the modules directory to the php 
	extensions directory (you can make this file smaller by running strip
	on it). PHP extensions directory is usually found on /usr/lib/php5/
	On ubuntu 10.04 this directory is /usr/lib/php5/20090626/
	
	If you want the wxWidget extension to be automatically loaded, add the
	following lines to your php.ini:
	
		; load php wxwidgets module
		extension=wxwidgets.so
		
	If not, then enable dynamic loading on your php.ini usually on
	/etc/php5/cli/php.ini > enable_dl = On
	

Running the examples
========================================================================

In order to run the examples provided you need to install php cli version.
On ubuntu this is done by running:

	sudo apt-get install php5-cli
	
To run the examples change on your console to the examples directory
and run the php interpreter on each file:

	php thread.php
		
on windows you can also do
	
	php-win thread.php
