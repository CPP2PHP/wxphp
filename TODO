Short term TODO
==============================

* (DONE) Compilation testing and troubleshooting on windows

* (DONE) Compilation testing and troubleshooting on mac

* (FIXED) Fix segmentation fault on wxGTK when no wxApp is initialized.

* (MAY NOT APPLY ANYMORE) Possibly declare char _wxResource[] = "wxResource" 
  and other char strings passed to functions as const.

* Implement __set to write to internal wxWidgets class properties.

* Implement compare_objects handler for wxWidget classes that implement
  operator== etc...
  
* Use zend_parse_parameters_none() to produce a nicer error on 
  methods/functions that dont accept parameters.
  
* Don't use zend_error outside the engine, but use
  php_error_docref which gives a nicer error message.
  
* Add zend_error on event connect in case user passes wrong count of
  arguments

* Modify the debian and arch package generators to add a wxphp 
  shell script that executes php -d extension=wxwidgets.so $@
