Short term TODO
==============================

* Fix segmentation bug that occurs on shutdown (FIXED).

* Check why PHP Segfaults when loading the library from the php.ini while
  loading it with dl function works as expected. (FIXED)

* fix xml_parser not using <array>[]</array> on argument types (DONE)

* Update config.w32 and configd.w32 to use new wxWidgets 2.9.x (almost done)

* Compilation testing and troubleshooting on windows

* Compilation testing and troubleshooting on mac

* Implement __set to write to internal wxWidgets class properties.

* Implement compare_objects handler for wxWidget classes that implement
  operator== etc...
  
* Fix strange behaviour on wxOSX where the application receives mouse
  events correctly but not keyboard ones. I suspect of the way
  we are initliazing the wxPHP library to run applications.
  
  
Long term TODO
==============================

* Approach a more object oriended style for the source maker

* Develop a modules architecture in order to use the source maker to
  generate the PHP bindings for any library with doxygen documentation.
